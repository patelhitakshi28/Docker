# Docker

To set up a MySQL database using Docker, you first pull the official MySQL image from Docker Hub and run a container with it, specifying a root password and mapping the container's port to your local machine's port. Then, you open MySQL Workbench, create a new connection using localhost and the root credentials, and test the connection to ensure it's successful. This setup allows you to manage and interact with a MySQL database running inside a Docker container from MySQL Workbench on your local machine.


# Working on creating new project out of this setup, I'll be updating this repository with complete description of the project as soon as it is completed.
